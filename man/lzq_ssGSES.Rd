\title{Generate single-sample gene-set enrichment score}
\usage{
lzq_ssGSES(exp, gene.list, method = "ssgsea")
}
\arguments{
\item{exp}{Expression matrix with genes as rows and samples as columns}

\item{gene.list}{List of gene sets, where each element is a character vector of gene names}

\item{method}{Method for calculating enrichment scores ("ssgsea", "gsva", "zscore"). Default is "ssgsea".}
}
\value{
A data frame of enrichment scores with samples as rows and gene sets as columns
}
\description{
Calculates single-sample gene set enrichment scores using various methods
including ssGSEA, GSVA, and z-score. These methods estimate pathway activity
for individual samples rather than comparing between groups.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Calculate ssGSEA scores
ssgsea_scores <- lzq_ssGSES(exp = expression_matrix, 
                           gene.list = pathway_gene_sets)

# Use GSVA method instead
gsva_scores <- lzq_ssGSES(exp = expression_matrix, 
                         gene.list = pathway_gene_sets,
                         method = "gsva")
}
