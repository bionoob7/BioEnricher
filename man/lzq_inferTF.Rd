\usage{
lzq_inferTF(
  exp,
  organism = "Human",
  use.cancer.regulons = F,
  confidences = c("A", "B", "C")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{exp}{Expression matrix with genes as rows and samples as columns}

\item{organism}{Organism for analysis ("Human" or "Mouse"). Default is "Human".}

\item{use.cancer.regulons}{Logical, whether to use cancer-specific regulons. Default is FALSE.}

\item{confidences}{Vector of confidence levels to include ("A", "B", "C", "D", "E"). Default is c("A", "B", "C").}
}
\value{
A matrix of transcription factor activity scores with TFs as rows and samples as columns
}
\description{
Infers transcription factor (TF) activities from gene expression data using
the VIPER (Virtual Inference of Protein-activity by Enriched Regulon analysis)
algorithm with DoRothEA regulons. This method estimates TF activity based on
the expression of their target genes.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Infer TF activities from expression data
tf_activities <- lzq_inferTF(exp = expression_matrix)

# Use cancer-specific regulons with high confidence only
tf_activities <- lzq_inferTF(exp = expression_matrix, 
                            use.cancer.regulons = TRUE,
                            confidences = c("A", "B"))
