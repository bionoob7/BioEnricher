\arguments{
\item{exp}{Expression matrix with genes as rows and samples as columns}

\item{scale}{Logical, whether to scale the pathway scores. Default is TRUE.}

\item{organism}{Organism for analysis ("Human" or "Mouse"). Default is "Human".}

\item{top}{Number of top responsive genes to use per pathway. Default is 100.}

\item{perm}{Number of permutations for significance testing. Default is 1.}

\item{z_scores}{Logical, whether to return z-scores. Default is FALSE.}

\item{get_nulldist}{Logical, whether to return null distribution. Default is FALSE.}

\item{assay_name}{Name of the assay (for SingleCellExperiment objects). Default is "RNA".}

\item{return_assay}{Logical, whether to return as assay. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A matrix of pathway activity scores with pathways as rows and samples as columns
}
\description{
Estimates pathway activity scores using PROGENy (Pathway RespOnsive GENes for activity inference).
PROGENy infers pathway activity from gene expression based on a curated set of
pathway responsive genes for 14 cancer-relevant pathways.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Basic PROGENy analysis
pathway_scores <- lzq_progeny(exp = expression_matrix)

# Use top 50 genes per pathway
pathway_scores <- lzq_progeny(exp = expression_matrix, top = 50)
}
