\title{Perform differential analysis for the PROGENy results}
\usage{
lzq_progeny.dea(
  progeny.res,
  groups,
  control.group,
  theme.plot = theme_classic(base_line_size = 0.8)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{progeny.res}{Matrix of PROGENy pathway scores with samples as rows and pathways as columns}

\item{groups}{Vector indicating group membership for each sample}

\item{control.group}{Name of the control group for comparison}

\item{theme.plot}{ggplot2 theme for the output plot. Default is theme_classic(base_line_size = 0.8).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item result - Data frame with statistical test results for each pathway
\item plot - Horizontal barplot showing t-statistics for pathway activities
}
}
\description{
Performs differential analysis on PROGENy pathway activity scores between different groups.
Uses linear modeling to test for significant differences in pathway activities
and creates a visualization showing the results.
